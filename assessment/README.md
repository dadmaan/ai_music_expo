# AI Music Generation Examples

This directory contains music examples generated by the MusicGen and Riffusion models. This collection showcases the capabilities of these music generation models in response to specific prompts designed to test their ability to capture various musical styles and elements.

The models have been used to generate music that aligns with a series of prompts focusing on different musical attributes. The examples demonstrate the model's ability to produce compositions that reflect the specified instructions.

## About the Project
